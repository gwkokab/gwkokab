GWKokab is a JAX-based gravitational-wave population inference toolkit. It is designed to be a high-performance, flexible, easy-to-use library for sampling from a wide range of gravitational-wave population models. It is built on top of JAX, a high-performance numerical computing library, and is designed to be easily integrated into existing JAX workflows.
