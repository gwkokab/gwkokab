GWKokab is a JAX-based gravitational-wave population inference package. It is built on top
of [Jaxampler](https://github.com/Qazalbash/jaxampler) and provides a high-level interface for sampling from a wide
range of gravitational-wave population models.

It is currently under active development and is not ready for production use. If you would like to contribute, please
see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

<!-- ## Features

- [x] ðŸš€ High-Performance Sampling: Leverage the power of JAX for high-speed, accurate sampling.
- [x] ðŸ§© Versatile Algorithms: A wide range of sampling methods to suit various applications.
- [x] ðŸ”— Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrates with existing JAX workflows. -->

## Installation

First, setup the virtual environment,

```bash
pip install --upgrade venv
python -m venv jvenv
source jvenv/bin/activate
```

Now, you may install the latest released version of GWKokab through pip by doing

```bash
pip install --upgrade gwkokab
```

You may install the bleeding edge version by cloning this repo, or doing

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/gwkokab/gwkokab
```

If you would like to take advantage of CUDA, you will additionally need to install a specific version of JAX by doing

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Requirements

GWKokab requires Python 3.10 or higher. It also requires the following packages:

```bash
configargparse
jaxampler
numpy
tqdm
RIFT
```

The test suite is based on pytest. To run the tests, one needs to install pytest and run `pytest` at the root directory
of this repo.

## Usage

GWKokab is designed to be used as a library. It provides a high-level interface for sampling from a wide range of
gravitational-wave population models. Following example shows how to generate mock population data. It is a two step
process:

1. **Generate a configuration file** such as the one shown below or one in the [repository](example_config.ini). This
   file specifies the population model to be used, the parameters to be sampled, and the names of the columns in the
   output file.

   ```ini
   [general]
   size = 100
   error_scale = 1.0
   error_size = 4000
   root_container = data
   event_filename = event_{}.dat
   config_filename = configuration.csv
   save_injections = True
   
   [mass_model]
   model = Wysocki2019MassModel
   config_vars = ['alpha_m','mmin','mmax']
   col_names = ['m1_source','m2_source']
   params = {'alpha_m':0.8,'k':0,'mmin':5.0,'mmax':40.0,'Mmax':80.0,'name':'Wysocki2019MassModel_test'}
   
   [spin1_model]
   model = Wysocki2019SpinModel
   config_vars = ['alpha','beta']
   col_names = ['chi1_source']
   params = {'alpha':1.8,'beta':0.9,'chimax':1.0,'name':'Wysocki2019SpinModel_test'}
   
   [spin2_model]
   model = Wysocki2019SpinModel
   config_vars = ['alpha','beta']
   col_names = ['chi2_source']
   params = {'alpha':0.8,'beta':1.9,'chimax':1.0,'name':'Wysocki2019SpinModel_test'}
   
   [ecc_model]
   model = EccentricityModel
   config_vars = ['sigma_ecc']
   col_names = ['sigma_ecc']
   params = {'sigma_ecc':0.8,'name':'EccModel_test'}
   ```

2. **Generate mock population data** by running the following command,

    ```bash
    gwkokab_genie -c <path_to_config_file>
    ```

For this example the output directory will look like this,

```bash
data
â”œâ”€â”€ configuration.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ event_0.dat
â”œâ”€â”€ event_1.dat
...
â””â”€â”€ event_99.dat
```

**Note** this will only work for one model. Multiple models are not supported yet.
